Commercial Lines
The lines of insurance that affects the business operations in the real terms are categorized under the Commercial Lines of Insurance. Type of the insurance covers that one can buy may include:</p>
<p>Property Insurance</p>
<p>Engineering Insurance</p>
<p>Liability Insurance</p>
<p>Marine Insurance</p>
<p>Employees Benefit Insurance</p>
<p>Depending on the type of occupation, risk exposure, and the money involved, the insurance could be different for each industry or business. For example; an insurance that is specific to a cement plant, versus one for an IT company will be different.</p><p> The premium charged for a cement plant will be higher than a showroom of air conditioner. Therefore, Insurance is completely based on the level of the risk exposure. A worker in the cement plant is more prone or susceptible to injury than to the one who is working in the showroom.</p>
